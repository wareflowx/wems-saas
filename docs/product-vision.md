# Product Vision

## Executive Summary

The Employee Management System is an internal desktop application designed to transform how our HR team manages employee information and administrative compliance. By replacing Excel-based manual processes with a centralized, intelligent system, we aim to eliminate administrative overhead, reduce compliance risks, and provide real-time visibility into workforce status.
